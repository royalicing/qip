# Browser Elements

QIP provides three custom elements organized around the user's relationship to a component. Use `<qip-view>` to consume a result, `<qip-edit>` to author inputs, and `<qip-play>` to interact with a running component.

```text
view    consume
edit    author
play    interact
```

These names describe the user experience, not implementation concepts such as rendering, pipelines, transforms, or static generation.

| Element | User relationship | Input or state owner | Lifecycle | Pre-rendering |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<qip-view>` | Consume | The page or application | Finite rendering | The complete output can be rendered at build time or on the server; client activation can be optional |
| `<qip-edit>` | Author | User-editable form controls | Reactive finite rendering | The initial output can be pre-rendered, but client activation is required for editing |
| `<qip-play>` | Interact | The running QIP component | Persistent, stateful session | A fallback, poster, or initial snapshot can be pre-rendered, but interaction requires activation |

## Choosing An Element

1. Use `<qip-view>` when the user consumes a result whose source is owned by the page or application.
2. Use `<qip-edit>` when the user changes source inputs and QIP reactively updates the outputs.
3. Use `<qip-play>` when the component owns an ongoing stateful session and responds to interaction over time.

The distinction is the overall user experience, not the presence of a particular form-control attribute:

- A published Markdown document with its source in a hidden input is a view.
- A Markdown authoring interface is an edit.
- An editor temporarily locked by permissions remains an edit: it is still fundamentally an authoring interface.
- A game, simulation, or other persistent interactive component is a play experience.

## `<qip-view>`

`<qip-view>` is the finite, consumption-oriented element. Its standalone module currently duplicates `<qip-edit>`'s wiring, rendering, and module policy. Keeping one entrypoint per element makes loading and replacement predictable; shared implementation can be introduced later without changing the public routes.

The page or application owns the canonical input, and the user consumes the resulting representation rather than editing it. Inputs may be supplied with hidden or read-only controls:

```html
<qip-view>
  <source src="/components/text/markdown/commonmark.0.31.2.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <input type="hidden" name="input" value="# Rendered ahead of time" />
  <output name="output"><h1>Rendered ahead of time</h1></output>
</qip-view>
```

A view performs a finite rendering operation. Its output may be generated at build time or on the server, and a pre-rendered view stays useful without client-side execution merely to display existing output. The browser may render or rerender the view when the application explicitly asks for it.

## Rendering Times

Finite rendering can observe values from three different eras:

```text
build time → request time → interaction time
```

Here, time is logical: it says which value came after another, not how many
seconds passed. This remains useful when values are synchronized without
requiring clocks to agree.

- **Build time** supplies authored inputs and fallbacks while producing a static page or server template.
- **Request time** applies values available only when a server handles a URL, such as explicitly permitted search parameters.
- **Interaction time** is the current browser state after a person or client-side application changes a control.

Each later era may override a value without destroying the earlier value it
came from. This lets the same markup provide a static fallback, a complete
server-rendered response, and optional client-side enhancement.

| Environment | Initial values | Where QIP runs | What remains possible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static page without JavaScript | Build-time fallbacks | During the build | The complete fallback result is readable and form submission can navigate normally |
| Server with no JavaScript | Build-time fallbacks plus request-time values | While serving the request | The response contains the complete result; a form can submit another request |
| Static page with JavaScript | Build-time fallbacks, then values connected from the current URL | During the build and locally in the browser | Wasm can rerender after URL or form-control changes without a server renderer |
| Server with JavaScript | Request-time values in the initial response, followed by live control values | On the server initially and locally thereafter | The page works before activation and can rerender without another request after activation |

### Preserving Value Eras

One proposed finite-rendering element is
`<qip-connect-search-params>`. It explicitly connects permitted URL search
parameters to ordinary hidden form controls:

```html
<qip-connect-search-params>
  <input type="hidden" name="language" value="en">
  <input type="hidden" name="currency" value="AUD">
</qip-connect-search-params>
```

A build transform can preserve each authored `value` as
`data-qip-fallback`. A request-time renderer then writes the resolved value to
the normal `value` attribute:

```html
<qip-connect-search-params>
  <input
    type="hidden"
    name="language"
    value="fr"
    data-qip-fallback="en"
  >
</qip-connect-search-params>
```

The three representations have distinct ownership:

| Era | Representation | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Build time | `data-qip-fallback` | Authored fallback snapshot retained by the build |
| Request time | The serialized `value` attribute | Value selected for the server-rendered response, or the fallback when no request value exists |
| Interaction time | The live input `value` DOM property | Current browser value, which may differ from the serialized request snapshot |

The browser custom element can restore `data-qip-fallback` when a search
parameter disappears, update the live value when the URL changes, and notify
the enclosing finite renderer. Without JavaScript, the hidden inputs remain
successful form controls and carry the server-selected or fallback values into
the next submission.

This is a proposed API rather than part of the current browser-element
contract. Its server and browser implementations should share fixtures that
verify they select the same parameters and produce byte-identical
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` input.

## `<qip-edit>`

`<qip-edit>` is the finite, authoring-oriented element. The user authors one or more declared inputs; QIP performs finite renders in response to relevant input changes and writes the result to the declared outputs. Use "edit element" when a noun is needed in prose.

The element is intentionally small: the page provides input controls, Wasm sources, and output views; the runtime wires them together.

```html
<form aria-label="Markdown to HTML">
  <qip-edit>
    <source src="/components/text/markdown/commonmark.0.31.2.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
    <source src="/components/text/html/html-code-syntax-highlight-tsx.wasm" type="application/wasm" />

    <textarea name="input" rows="5" placeholder="Write some Markdown"># A Markdown renderer that works identically cross-platform! Try typing…</textarea>

    <output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
    <output name="output"><iframe title="Rendered HTML preview" sandbox></iframe></output>
  </qip-edit>
</form>
```

Initial output may be rendered ahead of time, but client activation is still required for the element to respond to later edits. A temporarily read-only authoring experience is still an edit rather than a view.

### Contract

Each edit element needs at least one QIP component, one input, and one output:

```html
<qip-edit>
  <source src="/components/text/markdown/commonmark.0.31.2.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <textarea name="input"># Hello</textarea>
  <output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
</qip-edit>
```

The runtime reads from the first child with `name="input"`. It runs each `<source type="application/wasm">` as a pipeline stage in document order. It then writes the same output bytes into every `<output name="output">`.

Multiple outputs are multiple views of one result. They are not multiple return values from the component.

### Output Views

`<output name="output">` is the semantic binding. Its child element declares how the page wants to show the bytes.

```html
<output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
<output name="output"><iframe title="Rendered HTML preview" sandbox></iframe></output>
<output name="output"><img alt="Generated image preview" /></output>
```

For UTF-8 output, the runtime looks inside each output for `pre > code` or `iframe`.

- `pre > code` receives the decoded output as `textContent`.
- `iframe` receives the decoded output as `srcdoc`. For `text/html` output, the runtime appends a low-specificity default sans-serif body style. Use `sandbox` for rendered HTML.
- Without either child, decoded text is written directly to the `<output>`.

For `image/*` output, an `img` child receives an object URL for the rendered image. This is the right view for SVG, PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, ICO, or WebP output. If there is no `img`, SVG and other UTF-8 image formats can still be shown as text with `pre > code`.

Binary output without a matching view falls back to a short hex listing in the `<output>`.

### Binary Input

Text inputs cover UTF-8 transforms; binary payloads have two HTML-native forms.

A `<source name="input">` declares the input. The runtime fetches it, and its `type` attribute becomes the pipeline's initial content type:

```html
<qip-edit>
  <source name="input" src="/data/countries.sqlite" type="application/vnd.sqlite3" />
  <source src="/components/application/vnd.sqlite3/sqlite-schema.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
</qip-edit>
```

Every other `<source>` is a pipeline stage. The naming follows the element's existing `name="output"` and `name="uniform-*"` wiring, and the input can itself be a wasm module — for example, feeding one into `wasm-strict-profile.wasm`:

```html
<qip-edit>
  <source name="input" src="/components/utf8/luhn.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <source src="/components/application/wasm/wasm-strict-profile.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
</qip-edit>
```

With an input `<source>` present, a separate input control is optional. `data:` URLs work for inlining small payloads.

An `<input type="file" name="input">` supplies the chosen file's bytes and content type instead. With no file selected it falls back to the input `<source>`, so a page can ship default data that visitors override with their own file:

```html
<qip-edit>
  <source name="input" src="/data/countries.sqlite" type="application/vnd.sqlite3" />
  <source src="/components/application/vnd.sqlite3/sqlite-schema.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <input type="file" name="input" accept=".sqlite,application/vnd.sqlite3" />
  <output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
</qip-edit>
```

Precedence: a chosen file wins, then the input `<source>`, then the input element's text.

### Module Policy

Components use fixed memory by default. Add a byte cap when the page needs a tighter resource boundary:

```html
<qip-edit max-memory="67108864">
  <source src="/components/text/markdown/commonmark.0.31.2.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
  <textarea name="input"># Hello</textarea>
  <output name="output"><pre><code></code></pre></output>
</qip-edit>
```

- `max-memory="<bytes>"` rejects a module whose declared memory minimum or maximum exceeds the cap. If a module has memory but no declared maximum, it is rejected.
- `allow-memory-grow` permits `memory.grow` and requires `max-memory` on the same element.

These checks run after the module bytes are fetched and before `WebAssembly.compile`. `<qip-view>` and `<qip-play>` accept the same attributes.

## `<qip-play>`

`<qip-play>` is the persistent, interaction-oriented element. The component remains instantiated over time, owns or participates in an evolving stateful session, and user events can affect subsequent output.

```html
<qip-play>
  <source src="/components/interactive/snake.wasm" type="application/wasm" />
</qip-play>
```

The distinction from `<qip-edit>` is not merely that both accept interaction. Editing changes declared source inputs and produces finite results; playing interacts with a running component whose state persists between events. A fallback, poster, or initial snapshot may be rendered ahead of time, but the experience requires client activation to become interactive.

The element supports the [Timed and Eventful
contract](/docs/timed-and-eventful-components): `begin_update_at`, complete
update uniforms, timestamp-free events, `finish_update`, separate
presentation, and canonical KTX2 output. `calculator` uses the
application-style path. `snake` combines events with fixed-step scheduled
wakes. See also [Interactive Component Contract](/docs/interactive-component)
and [Interactive Rendering Performance](/docs/interactive-rendering-performance).

## Pre-Rendering

Prefer the terms pre-rendered, build-time rendered, or server-rendered over calling the consumption element "static".

A view is not necessarily unchanging: application code may explicitly rerender it when externally owned data changes. Likewise, an edit may begin with pre-rendered output even though it later becomes reactive. The distinction stays:

```text
view    consume a finite result
edit    author inputs and produce finite results
play    interact with a persistent session
```

— not static versus dynamic.

## Externally Managed Data

`<qip-view>` is not intended to own application data loading. Authentication, network requests, caching, retries, and invalidation belong in application code or a developer-defined custom element, which can invoke QIP's rendering functions and control when a component is loaded or rerendered:

```html
<account-usage-report account="123"></account-usage-report>
```

A custom element such as `<account-usage-report>` can own authenticated fetching and caching while using QIP internally for deterministic rendering.
