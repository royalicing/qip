A quarter-by-quarter view of Shutterstock earnings with the SSTK share price drawn over the same reporting periods.

Controls:

- Hover the chart or use the arrow keys to inspect a quarter
- `1`: revenue

- `3`: diluted EPS

Data notes:

- Financials use SEC companyfacts for Shutterstock, Inc. CIK `0001549346`.
- Q4 financials are derived from full-year totals minus Q1-Q3 because the SEC frame data reports the 10-K as an annual period.
- Share prices use Nasdaq quarter-end closes, or the previous trading day when the quarter ended on a market holiday or weekend.
