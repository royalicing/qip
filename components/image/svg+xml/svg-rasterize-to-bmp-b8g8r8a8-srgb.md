# SVG to B8G8R8A8 sRGB BMP

`svg-rasterize-to-bmp-b8g8r8a8-srgb.wasm` rasterizes the repository's
supported SVG subset into a 32-bit BMP. The BMP pixel array uses B8G8R8A8
channel bytes and bottom-up rows. QIP treats the colour channels as sRGB. Use
the KTX2 rasterizer for new pipelines; keep this variant where a later stage
requires BMP.

The SVG root must declare numeric `width` and `height` attributes.
`background_color_rgba` accepts `0xRRGGBBAA` and defaults to transparent
black. The uniform resets to its default after each render.

```sh
./qip run \
  components/image/svg+xml/svg-rasterize-to-bmp-b8g8r8a8-srgb.wasm \
  -u background_color_rgba=0xffffffff \
  -i input.svg -o output.bmp
```

SVG input is limited to 1 MiB. Output images are limited to 25,000,000 pixels
and 8192 pixels on either axis. Missing, zero, or excessive dimensions reject
the input.
