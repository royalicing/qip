# Pathological-input time budgets for the markdown components.
#
# Each case renders a generated adversarial input through the GFM component
# (the superset build of components/text/markdown/lib/commonmark.zig) under a
# hard `qip run --timeout-ms` budget. A trap or timeout fails the suite. This
# is the regression fence for inline/block parser performance work — in
# particular the planned delimiter-stack rewrite (see the TODO block in
# components/text/markdown/lib/commonmark.zig).
#
# Budgets are calibrated to measured 2026-08-17 behavior on an M-series
# laptop, roughly 3x the observed time, and fall into two groups:
#   - TIGHT cases: currently fast; a budget breach means a superlinear
#     regression crept in.
#   - KNOWN-SLOW cases: currently superlinear (emphasis lookahead, reference
#     definition collection, nested-list re-copying). Their budgets only stop
#     things getting worse. After the delimiter-stack rewrite and the
#     block-level fixes, tighten every KNOWN-SLOW budget to TIGHT levels —
#     these inputs should all render in well under a second.
#
# Usage: tools/test-markdown-pathological.sh (from the repo root)
# Env: QIP_BIN (default ./qip), WASM (default the GFM component)
